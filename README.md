# portfolio

this is my portfolio project for Google Udacity Front-End Dev. Challenge

---

#The problem: 
Although the local `Gruntfile.js` has almost the exact same syntax and dependencies and the packages and 
the versions as the Project-Part-1/Project-Part-2/Project-Part-3 files of Responsive Images Course, when 
I try running grunt in this dir it pops an error:

``` 
>> No "clean" targets found.
Warning: Task "clean" failed. Use --force to continue.

Aborted due to warnings.
```

I tried node versions 8.11.0 and 9.8.0 nothing worked so far
