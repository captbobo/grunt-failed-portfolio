# portfolio project

this is my portfolio project for Google Udacity Front-End Dev. Challenge

#Current problem: 
when I run `grunt` it returns:

```
Running "responsive_images:dev" (responsive_images) task
 Unable to compile; no valid source files were found.
 Unable to compile; no valid source files were found.
 Unable to compile; no valid source files were found.
```

I don't understand the issue since in the `Gruntfile.js` all the file names and syntax seems to be correct!
